##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that padding, borders, and margin are going to need a lot more getting used to for me. The box model concept is fairly simple, yet putting those concepts to practice requires a lot of experimentation and research. It took me a few hours and some rest to figure out that I needed to adjust the bottom padding on my main section to the same value as the height of my footer, so that the footer wouldn't cover any content above it. Knowing things like that takes experience and a lot practice.
  
##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I got more practice with positioning, but like the box model, it is a concept that requires a lot more practice to fully get. I watched a pretty good video about relative and absolute positioning and how they relate to each other.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest were things like font color, background color, and box height and width. The most difficult was positioning and getting my tables to look how I wanted them to (or close enough).
  
##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that HTML and CSS should work together. Not being experienced in this field I found that I had to go back and adjust some parts of my HTML so that I can style them in CSS. I think with time I will learn how to write HTML with CSS in mind.
