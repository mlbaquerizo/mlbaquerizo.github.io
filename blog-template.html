How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This challenge gave me some perspective on what it is like collaborating with different people on design. We started off at slightly different paces, but eventually we got the ball rolling and worked together effectively. Starting from scratch with just a wireframe seemed very daunting but taking it one step or area at a time helps.
  
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing is definitely helpful in the development process. I don't think I would be able to have a picture in my head and start coding based on that.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We wanted to get what we thought the basics for a good website done. We made sure to add a heading and a navigation bar with links to other parts of our website. A side bar with links to other blogs also seemed like a necessary addition.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We looked into semantic elements and decided that using <header>, <nav>, <aside>, and <main> would be smart. We did not focus so much on formatting of the web page because from what I understand (and iterated to my pair), those semantic tags we used would allow for easy formatting with CSS.
