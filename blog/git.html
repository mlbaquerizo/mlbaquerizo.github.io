      <h2>Tracking Changes - Version Control</h2>

      Imagine having a time machine. This time machine lets you go back to any of your previous birthdays and fix any mistakes you have made in between birthdays. Your birthday is a good, happy day. Everyone likes you, you like you, you're happy. But you may want to change things about yourself or make yourself even better by your next birthday. So you use this time machine whenever you mess up, fix those mistakes, and by your next birthday you are happy with all of those changes you made. Right now, at 2AM Monday morning, this is the best analogy I could think up for version control.
    <p>
      Version control in development is the ability to save good, stable code, and work up from that point without worrying about ruining your good code. That is, you can go back to your good code at any point in case you make a mistake or don't like the changes you made to it. You always have that good code to fall back on. This makes for an organized and efficient work flow. In the development world there is a "time machine" and that is a piece of software called Git.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a version control software that is controlled from the command line to allow the user to keep track of his or her work. It utilizes a clever branching and merging design that allows for worry-free refining and experimentation. Typically a developer will start off inside a master "branch", which should house the most up to date stable code. But any time the developer wants to build off of that, he/she can branch outside of the master. Git will create a carbon copy of the master, which can be worked on, edited, refined in any way. If the developer is not happy with those changes, the whole branch could be deleted and nothing will happen to the master branch. If the developer is happy with those changes, then a snapshot, called a commit, can be saved and eventually merged into the master branch. Git is also capable of communicating with the internet and sharing your work online. Github.com helps with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Github takes git a step further, allowing developers to collaborate and store their work online. Apart from graphically showcasing commits made and making it easy to merge changes, it is a hub for teams of developers that want to work together seamlessly. Github allows for multiple people to work on the same project at the same time, without worrying about any of thier changes being overwritten by any others' changes. There is also a social aspect to Github; users are able to browse public repositories (project source files -- the code that makes up a program) and contribute to other developers projects.
