      <h2>JavaScript Objects Vs. Ruby Hashes</h2>
      <h4>01-15-2016</h4>

      Here we are again. Middle of the night. Should be asleep. Feeling loopy. But I'm here, so we're gonna talk about JavaScript. And some Ruby. Specifically JavaScript objects and Ruby hashes, and how they are alike and how they are different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby hashes are like dictionaries. They're lists of key/value pairs. Javascript objects are pretty much just that: lists of key/value pairs. But we use different terminology. In JavaScript, object "keys" would be called properties. Property values are assigned using expressions -- Any code that has a value. Property values can be arrays, numbers, strings, booleans. So far this is exactly what a Ruby hash is. And in Ruby, a hash can be classified as an object. JavaScript objects are even written just like Ruby hashes when the keys are symbols. And properties can be added and removed from objects, just like in Ruby hashes!
    </p>
    <p>
      So what makes these two different? Well, the big difference is in the concept of an "object". In Ruby, almost anything is an object; Strings, Arrays, Numbers, Booleans, even Hashes...They're all objects. Hashes are just objects that have object keys and object values. So hash keys can be symbols, strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, hashes...
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, property values can be any of those things, but the property itself can only be what is similar to a Hash symbol. So Hashes are better, right? They're more versatile than JavaScript objects... 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, here's something a Ruby hash can't do. JavaScript objects are able to take functions as property values. Ruby hashes can't do that with methods, since methods aren't objects! We can make a value in our object perform a block of code. In this way, they act as instance methods of Ruby Classes. You would need to make a whole Class to do the same thing in Ruby!
