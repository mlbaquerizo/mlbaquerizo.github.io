      One fundamental concept in understanding CSS and styling HTML is the box model. Understanding this core concept unlocks the potential to create beautifully laid out websites.
    <p>
      So, in HTML files we have elements. Pretty much anything surrounded by a tag is an element in that file. What's inside that tag is the content of that element. Now picture a box around that element. Wait, even better, here's a picture of that box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../imgs/box-model.png" alt="Box Model" title="Box Model-w3s">
    <p>
      We see that the content of your element is surrounded by layers. From the inside out, you have padding, then border, then margin. Those are the layers of the element. What is cool about these is that each can be sized individually to achieve your desired style or position on the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do they relate and differ? Think about padding and border as being part of your element. Padding is a transparent space directly outside of the content. So, you have some text inside a &ltp&gt tag. The text is surrounded by a transparent box, called the padding. Now say you want to add a solid border around your text. Where would that border be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, right on the edge of your padding! Note that while padding is transparent, border can be made visible. You can make the border any thickness and color you desire. That said, you can adjust the thickness of your padding as well, just not the color. Padding can only be transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how I said to think about padding and border as being part of your element. What about the margin? Well, it technically is a part of the element, but I like to think about margin as being <span class="em">outside</span> of your element. This is because, like padding, it is also transparent. It is easy to think about border as being the outer-most layer of an element because it can actually be seen. But you can add more space outside of your border. This is useful for spacing your element in any direction on the screen. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These are just the basics of the box model. When used in conjunction with positioning and other styling concepts in CSS, the box model is a powerful and absolutely necessary tool. So master it!
