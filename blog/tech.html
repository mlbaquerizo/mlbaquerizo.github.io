      <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
      <h4>02-01-2016</h4>

    <p>
      The topic of regular expressions has been on my list of things to research for quite some time. Many times when looking up ways to refactor my code I come across a post about using regular expressions on StackOverflow or a similar site. This has intrigued me, but when I try to decipher regular expressions, I get completely confused as to how they work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular expressions are similar to wildcards. They use symbols as placeholders to help match strings that contain the specified pattern. This is the main idea: Regular Expressions are used to look for strings. A string of characters or symbols is used as a pattern for which to look for srings. Regular expressions can be extremely powerful at what they are meant to do, but they take some research to get a full understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool thing about regular expressions is that they can be used the same way (with the same syntax) across various programming languages and text editors. The syntax remains the same across these applications, which makes regular expressions easier to learn, since you won't need to re-learn them for every new language that comes into style. Thus knowing how to use regular expressions to match text in your files can be an extremely useful and important skill, because it can greatly increase the efficiency of your workflow as well as clean up your files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main use for regular expressions is for finding text that matches a pattern. What can be done to the found text includes replacing the text with somethign else, adding to the text, and detecting if the text is valid input (i.e. a chosen password contains invalid characters). These are just some of the uses for regular expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When first looking at a regular expression, it might just look like a jumbled string of random letters, numbers, and symbols. But each seemingly random symbol or letter has a purpose, and looks for different things in a string of text. Let's look at regular expressions in Ruby. In Ruby, regular expressions are objects themselves, and Ruby recognized regular expressions by being wrapped between forward slashes, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><code>
  /fish/
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a simple regular expression, which has the literal string 'fish' between two forward slashes (which makes Ruby recognize fish as a regular expression). This will match 'fish' to any instances of 'fish' in the text that it is looking at. No wacky symbols here.
