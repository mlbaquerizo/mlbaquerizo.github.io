      Ruby allows us to create categories in which to store objects of those categories. These "categories" are called Classes. The best way to illustrate this is to pick a real-world object to model as a Class. So let's create a new class of musical instruments to get a better idea of how Classes work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating a class is simple:
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>    class Instrument
      def initialize(type)
        @type = type
      end
    end</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty simple. We define an initialize method so that we can create a new object of the class Instrument. We give it a 'type' attribute to keep track of the types of instruments we assign. Notice the '@' symbol in the @type variable. This is a special kind of variable called an instance variable. We use these in classes, so that we can call the variable in other methods we create for the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's add some attributes to our class. Instruments can fall into different categories (brass, string, woodwind, percussion, keyboard), so let's give it a 'family' attribute. We can add this into our initialize method:
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>    class Instrument
      attr_reader :type, :family
      def initialize(type, family)
        @type = type
        @family = family
      end
    end</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, a lot happened there. We added a family attribute. We also added something called attr_reader. This created some methods for objects in the Instrument class that make it easy to output the type or family of the instrument. Let's look at how this works by creating a guitar in the Instrument class:
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>    blackie = Instrument.new("guitar", "string")
    puts blackie.type
      => guitar
    puts guitar.family
      => string</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet. We just made one of Eric Clapton's most famous guitars. Let's now add a method that lets us add songs that can be played.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>    class Instrument
      attr_reader :type, :family, :songs
      def initialize(type, family, songs = [])
        @type = type
        @family = family
        @songs = songs
      end
      
      def add_song(song)
        @songs << song
      end
    end</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can add a 'songs' attribute as an array and an add_song method to add songs to that array. Now let's add some songs..
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>    blackie.add_song("Layla")
    p blackie.songs
      =>["Layla"]
    blackie.add_song("Cocaine")
    p blackie.songs
      =>["Layla", "Cocaine"]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now obviously we can expand on this class a lot by adding some new instruments and methods that give us outputs based on the type or family of the instrument. But I think from here we have a good understanding of Classes and why they could be useful. Because objects in a class share the same methods, we could easily add methods to the class, which could then be used by any object in the class. So, instead of having to tweak each individual object, we can tweak the class that contains that object. This makes for efficient programming.
